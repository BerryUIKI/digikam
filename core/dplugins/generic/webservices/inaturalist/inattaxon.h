/**
 * A taxon is obtained via the iNaturalist API and it is read-only; thus there
 * are no member functions to modify it and only const-references to its members
 * are returned.
 *
 * Taxa have a unique numeric id and a name - the scientific or Latin name.
 * Taxa also have a textual rank (e.g. 'species') and a numeric rank-level (10
 * for species).
 * The common name may not be present and its value depends on the locale: it
 * can be Chien, Gedomesticeerde Hond, Домашняя Собака, Domestic Dog, Haushund,
 * or Perro Doméstico for the iNaturalist taxon with id 47144 and scientific
 * name 'Canis familiaris'. Even in the same country and language common names
 * differ from place to place. E.g. 'Umbellularia californica' is the scientific
 * name of a tree in the laurel family that occurs in California and Oregon. Its
 * common name is 'California Bay Laurel' in California and 'Oregon Myrtle' in
 * Oregon.
 * Member 'ancestors' is a list of parent taxa ordered from the highest
 * rank 'kingdom' downwards. The url fetches a small, square-shape icon and is
 * unavailable for some taxa. The matched term is only non-empty for taxa
 * returned from auto-completion.
